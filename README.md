<strong><u>Module 7B â€“ Coding Assignment </u></strong>

For the problem statement below, you must review the Pseudocode for each part of the solution.  You will then write your code based on the feedback from your Pseudocode assignment.

<strong><u>Problem Statement</u></strong>:

Write an application that uses a bubble sort to sort an array of 10000 integers in the traditional way.  Write another application that uses parallelism to sort the same array 10000 integers.  Display the time it takes for each application to run (you will have to figure out how many decimal places to show in order for it to display properly).  Remember that the same array should be used as a starting point for each method of sorting.

<strong><u>Start writing the code from your pseudocode:</u></strong>

Code the solution from your pseudocode. Compile and debug all parts of your program to ensure it is correct.

<strong><u>Test</u></strong>

Test your code with sample data.

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be.  Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your code.
